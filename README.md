### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve. 

Currently, I'm working through the eCornell Machine Learning certificate course.  I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to complete the course in a pilot citizen Data Scientist program that my organization is trialing. ðŸ™Œ I previously completed the eCornell Python for Data Science certificate course.  

I'm about halfway through the course but just began taking notes in Notebooks with the most recent lesson I completed. 

[They're here.](https://github.com/sbogucki12/datascience)

- Please keep in mind that they're:
  - Incomplete
  - Working notes
  - Probably full of inaccuracies
  - Only potentially going to be cleaned up later, after completion of the course
  - Hopefully absent any proprietary course material. ðŸ¤ž


Professionally, I've changed positions and now manage a division within our Chief Data Office, overseeing our Analytics Enablement and Tools & Technology branches.  It's a really exciting opportunity, certianly one in which I intend to learn much!

Used ChatGPT to write the code for a resume functionality that I added to the portfolio I am building. [BOGOODSKI ChatGPT](https://sbogucki12.github.io/)  
I am using ChatGPT to the greatest extent possible to assist the coding process.

In just a few hours over two evenings, I was able to use ChatGPT and very little code to spin up a new site.  

Here is the repo:

Here is the site (github pages):

Here is the ChatGPT discussion, prompts that "developed" this site:

Completed lesson.  Learned how to code our own Support Vector Machines, how to match regularizers and loss functions, and how to add dimensionality to vectors utilizing the kernel trick.
