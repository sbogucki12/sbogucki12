### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve. 

Currently, I'm working through the eCornell Data Science certificate course.  I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to complete the course in a pilot citizen Data Scientist program that my organization is trialing. ðŸ™Œ I previously completed the eCornell Python for Data Science certificate course.  

I'm about halfway through the course but just began taking notes in Notebooks with the most recent lesson I completed. 

[They're here.](https://github.com/sbogucki12/datascience)

- Please keep in mind that they're:
  - Incomplete
  - Working notes
  - Probably full of inaccuracies
  - Only potentially going to be cleaned up later, after completion of the course
  - Hopefully absent any proprietary course material. ðŸ¤ž


Professionally, I've changed positions and now manage a division within our Chief Data Office, overseeing our Analytics Enablement and Tools & Technology branches.  It's a really exciting opportunity, certianly one in which I intend to learn much!

Completed lesson.  Learned how to code our own Support Vector Machines, how to match regularizers and loss functions, and how to add dimensionality to vectors utilizing the kernel trick.

Also, I've begun developing a portfolio website.  I've forgotten mostly how to webdev, so I am taking full advantage of ChatGPT.  Follow along as I use AI to build my website:
