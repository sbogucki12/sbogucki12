### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve.

Much has changed :) 

Currently, I'm working through the eCornell Data Science certificate course.  I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to complete the course in a pilot citizen Data Scientist program that my organization is trialing. ðŸ™Œ I previously completed the eCornell Python for Data Science certificate course.  

I'm about halfway through the course but just began taking notes in Notebooks with the most recent lesson I completed. 

[They're here.](https://github.com/sbogucki12/datascience)

 
- Please keep in mind that they're:
  - Incomplete
  - Working notes
  - Probably full of inaccuracies
  - Only potentially going to be cleaned up later, after completion of the course
  - Hopefully absent any proprietary course material. ðŸ¤ž


Professionally, I've changed positions and now manage a division within our Chief Data Office, overseeing our Analytics Enablement and Tools & Technology branches.  It's a really exciting opportunity, certianly one in which I intend to learn much!
