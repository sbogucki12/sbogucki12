### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve. 

Currently, I'm working through the eCornell Machine Learning certificate course.  I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to complete the course in a pilot citizen Data Scientist program that my organization is trialing. ðŸ™Œ I previously completed the eCornell Python for Data Science certificate course.  

I'm about halfway through the course but just began taking notes in Notebooks with the most recent lesson I completed. 

[They're here.](https://github.com/sbogucki12/datascience)

- Please keep in mind that they're:
  - Incomplete
  - Working notes
  - Probably full of inaccuracies
  - Only potentially going to be cleaned up later, after completion of the course
  - Hopefully absent any proprietary course material. ðŸ¤ž


Professionally, I've changed positions and now manage a division within our Chief Data Office, overseeing our Analytics Enablement and Tools & Technology branches.  It's a really exciting opportunity, certianly one in which I intend to learn much!

# Sept 9

Completed the final lesson in my eCornell Machine Learning certificate course!

This is crazy to me. Between this and the Python for Data Science course, these lessons started all the way back during LAST September. One year worth of two- and three-week lessons.

This final lesson was on neural networks. The first exercise challenged us to code a neural network from scratch, including the ReLU function, calculating mean squared loss, utilizing softmax to get probabilities, executing gradient descent, forward and backward propagation. Though I loved that coding from scratch demystified the neural network black box, I was happy that we were introduced to pytorch for the final two exercises: image recognition (convolutional neural network) and sequence/language models and recurrent neural networks.

I really appreciate the Federal Aviation Administration for giving us the opportunity to complete this training. I have a much better understanding of how these technologies work, and will be able to participate with my team and lead it more effectively because of it. Really excited for the work that we are doing!

Just added my Maui story.  I really put my heart into telling this exactly as I observed it.  [Please check it out.](https://bogoodski.com/maui.html)
