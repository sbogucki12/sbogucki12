### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve. 

Like Andy Bernard, I just completed the eCornell Machine Learning certificate course.

I previously completed the eCornell Python for Data Science certificate course.  

Starting about halfway through the course, I recorded my notes in ipynb notebooks.

I've been adding more practice data analysis in that repo...

Which dimensions of my runs most affect my pace?

I used ChatGPT as much as possible to help me generate the code.  Here's the prompts/discussion:
