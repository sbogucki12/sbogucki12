### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm Steve. My current activity:</p> 

<h3>Studying...</h3>

<ol>
  
  <li><p>Web development</p>
    <p><a href="https://lnkd.in/dn-_KavQ">Next.js By Example</a></p>
</li>
  <li><p>Music production</p>
    <p><a href="https://lnkd.in/dF2JV5P4">FL Studio 101 by Music-Prod</a></p>
</li>
  <li><p>Apache Spark</p>
    <a href="https://lnkd.in/dUvbs5dT">Databricks - How to Build a Cloud Data Platform</a>

</li>
  <li><p>Continuing to work through the <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">Interview Cake</a> just because I find it a legitiimately enjoyable learning resource.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The best learning is achieved by applying knowledge - so, building projects. But, in this case, I needed some hand-holding.</p>

<p>For React/Next, returning to a tutorial is figuratively a step backward in progress from me. But I'm rusty and want to unlearn some bad habits that I've incurred and, hopefully, replace them with proper industry standard techniques - that hopefully this course will provide.</p>

<p>Though I've used FL Studio to export my DJ mixes for years, I've never used the tool, as powerful as it is, for anything else. The step into music production is a foreign one for me, so the guidance of a teacher is going to help navigate the learning curve.</p>
