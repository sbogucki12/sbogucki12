### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve. 

Like Andy Bernard, I just completed the eCornell Machine Learning certificate course.

I previously completed the eCornell Python for Data Science certificate course.  

Starting about halfway through the course, I recorded my notes in ipynb notebooks.   

[They're here, though incomplete.](https://github.com/sbogucki12/datascience)

I've been adding more practice data analysis in that repo...

## Dec 26, 2023

I am working through Professor Leonard's math tutorials on YouTube.  I am collecting my notes in a repo.  [HERE](https://github.com/sbogucki12/math_tutorial). 

I have been very interested in updating my math skills.  I find math fascinating and love to read about it, but lack as much formal education as I'd like.

Just added my Maui story.  I really put my heart into telling this exactly as I observed it.  [Please check it out.](https://bogoodski.com/maui.html)
